    <h1>My Love for Baseball</h1>
    <p>Basbeall was my first love.  In fact, baseball was even my first word.  By the time I was three years old, I had already enrolled in a T-ball team and was miles ahead of the other kids. Baseball was everything I lived for as a kid.  As I grew up, I began playing travel ball and eventually made it to the big stage in Louisianna.  My team had made the international world series and we played Mexico in the final.  As we took the field, the whole crowd chanted USA, one of the coolest experiences of my life.  We ended up winning the game 11-1 and I will never forget the dog pile at the end of the game.  I'm also a die hard Dodger fan through and through and have still not stopped celebrating our world series win.</p>

    <h2>BYU Baseball</h2>
    <p>Although my baseball career came to an end in high school, I was lucky enough to apply to become a baseball team manager here at BYU.  After meeting with the coach I got the job.  Since, I have been helping the players run the workouts, compiling stats, and even get front row seats to every game to keep stats.  It has been surreal being able to take on this position for such a prestigous university especially given that it's baseball.</p>

  <section id="Dodgers">
    <h3>Los Angeles Dodgers</h3>
    <p>After I became a huge Dodger fan, my family followed suit and we became one huge Dodger family.  We have all gone to spring training countless times and have even had season tickets to Dodgers games for the past few seasons.</p>
